# Gov-2.0-Bootstrap-Skeleton
An HTML5/CSS3/Bootstrap skeleton to accompany the gov.bc.ca. Developer's Guide.

## Governance & Approvals   
All web properties that are created using the Province of B.C. brand/identity must have [received approval](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=28CC2BEFA54745EA8927F48F196FA38C) by Government Communications & Public Engagement Headquarters through the Joint Working Group, the official governing body of web properties for the Province.  If the web property is public facing, it is strongly recommended that this approval is sought before development begins as the project may experience delays, and potential shutdown.  

An example of a successful exemption request would be an application that requires the authentication of a user to gain access to personally identifiable information.  The corproate content management framework currenlty consists of CMS Lite, Enhanced Search, Geo Mapping Interfaces, Data Visualization tools and WordPress for citizen engagements and arm's length entities.  Once a web property is approved for exemption by the Joint Working Group, the usage of this skeleton is optional.

## Updates & Community Driven
This resource is a community driven resource, and as such is monitored by the community for improvements and collaboration efforts.  Please submit issues for related inquiries, questions or change requests for the community to respond.  Government resources for master branch approvals to this repo are limited, and though they will respond to change requests or inquiries,  actual response in a timely fashion is not guarunteed.

If Government Communications & Publc Engagement updates the design of the corporate tool set of gov.bc.ca web properties, any application built upon the Gov-2.0-Boostrap-Skeleton is mandated to update to the new look and feel.  The new design, standards and requirements will be posted within the gov.bc.ca [Developer's Guide](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=FC8B45CAD47E43F5A31E72B19EBCEAD1).

## Theme Contents
1. One-Column Template
2. Two-Column Template
3. Three-Column Template

## Accessibility
WCAG 2.0 accessibility requirements are included within this template, however, it is up to the developer and owner of the site to produce an accessible web product and therefore, user testing should be conducted to verify compliance and usability.  This is a requirement of all of the Province of British Columbia's web properties as per the [Accessibility 2024 mandate](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=7C8AEEC5235D46B8BBA1F6689023171C).
