# API Tests

The API tests use [Newman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/newman) to run the tests that are created in [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com).

* Develop your API Tests in Postman
* Export the collection (this results in a json file)
* Rename the file apitest.json and place it in this directory
* The pipeline will run your tests and report back in Jenkins.
