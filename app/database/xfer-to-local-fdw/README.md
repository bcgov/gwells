# Scripts to replicate Production WELLS data onto a local environment

## Replicate from the legacy Oracle database

All files and scripts in this xfer-to-local-fdw are temporary until we cut over to GWELLS from WELLS.  At that time, there will no longer be a need for replication from the legacy database, via the Postgres Foreign Data Wrapper.

This local environment supports the local testing of the data replication scripts.
