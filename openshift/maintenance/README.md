## Maintenance Mode

### Usage

Caddy pods serving static html are deployed to our prod, dev and test environments.  To enable maintenance mode switch the routes between the GWells and Proxy-Caddy services.  A namespace (project) for deployment must be specified.

Expected namespaces:

* moe-gwells-prod
* moe-gwells-dev
* moe-gwells-test

For the sake of simplicity all examples will use moe-gwells-test and be run on OS X.

1. ##### Enable/Disable by Script

    Maintenance mode on.

    ```
    ./maintenance.sh moe-gwells-test on
    ```

    Maintenance mode off.

    ```
    ./maintenance.sh moe-gwells-test off
    ```

2. ##### Enable/Disable by Command line

    Maintenance mode on.

    ```
    oc patch route gwells -n moe-gwells-test -p \
        '{ "spec": { "to": { "name": "proxy-caddy", "port": { "targetPort": "2015-tcp" }}}'
    oc patch route proxy-caddy -n moe-gwells-test -p \
        '{ "spec": { "to": { "name": "gwells" }, "port": { "targetPort": "web" }}}'
    ```

    Maintenance mode off.

    ```
    oc patch route gwells -n moe-gwells-test -p \
        '{ "spec": { "to": { "name": "gwells" }, "port": { "targetPort": "web" }}}'
    oc patch route proxy-caddy -n moe-gwells-test -p \
        '{ "spec": { "to": { "name": "proxy-caddy" }, "port": { "targetPort": "2015-tcp" }}}'
    ```
