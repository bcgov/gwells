# Groundwater Wells and Aquifers (GWELLS)

https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/gwells/

## Introduction

The Ministry of Environment receives and processes groundwater data and information related to the construction, alteration and decommissioning of groundwater wells. Well construction and reporting requirements are regulated under the Water Sustainability Act and Groundwater Protection Regulation. The information collected and stored is used by government and other users to help inform decisions related to the management of the groundwater resource in B.C.

GWELLS, the new groundwater data repository, aims to improve the user experience when submitting and searching for well information, to improve the quality of the data being submitted, and to improve the overall functionality of the system to meet user and regulatory requirements.

The application is being developed as an open source solution.

## Using the GWELLS API

GWELLS maintains a REST API where public data relating to wells is made available for other applications and services.

Our Swagger documentation is available at https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/gwells/api/.  Some examples of GWELLS endpoints:

Wells:
```sh
# all wells (paginated)
curl https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/gwells/api/v1/wells

# all wells in an area bounded by sw_lat, sw_long, ne_lat, and ne_long
curl https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/gwells/api/v1/wells?sw_lat=51.599253&sw_long=-128.220340&ne_lat=52.108192&ne_long=-127.150547
```

Aquifers:
```sh
# all aquifers
curl https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/gwells/api/v1/aquifers
```

See the [Swagger documentation](https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/gwells/api/) for more examples.

## DataBC Export

GWELLS Api is used by DataBC to export model information and provide well information on the DataBC website.

The command located in app/backend/gwells/management/commands/export_databc.py is used to pull data from the gwells database and export it for consumption in DataBC.

If a new field(s) are needed for export, this export_databc.py has raw sql queries that need to be updated with the required fields. Descriptions are also needed for the swagger documentation that are pulled from the db_comment fields in the django models. Both the raw sql queries and the db_comment field on the model need to be updated for new fields.

## Developing GWELLS

### Running the GWELLS application locally

[Clone the GWELLS repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository), and build the [Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community) image for the backend:
```sh
cd gwells/openshift/docker/backend
docker build . --tag=gwells/backend
```

Then, run the application with Docker:
```sh
cd gwells
docker-compose up
```

For gwells to interact with your local instance of Min.IO add the appropriate settings to your local machines HOSTS file:
```
127.0.0.1 minio-public
```

Visit the following links to browse the API and frontend applications:

* Django REST API development server: http://localhost:8000/gwells/api/
* Vue frontend development server: http://localhost:8080/

### Authentication

Some GWELLS pages (submitting new well reports, adding or editing aquifers, or adding or editing qualified well drillers to the registry) require authentication. Authentication uses the Province's Single Sign-On system. A GWELLS team member can request access for collaborators if needed.

### Running tests:

Django unit tests:
```sh
cd app/backend
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py test
```

Vue unit tests:
```sh
cd app/frontend
docker-compose exec frontend npm run test:unit
```

Postman API tests:
Import the json test collections in the `api-tests/` folder into [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/).

### Import a Shapefile

Single shapefile, with aquifer ID specified in CLI.

```
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py import_shapefile 2 aquifers/fixtures/shp/shapefile.zip
```

Bulk import, requires the AQ_NUMBER attribute on each polygon. Requires a folder with shapefiles to be prepared and passed in (zipped or not). Note: if DEBUG=True, all geometries will be uploaded to a random aquifer instead of the one matching its' number, so we can test locally with a development database.

```
mkdir app/backend/bulk
mv DATABC_EXPORT_FILE.zip app/backend/bulk/

docker-compose exec backend python manage.py import_bulk_shapefile bulk
```

### Importing Licences

To download new licence data from DataBC and merge it into your DB, do

```
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py import_licences
```

### Making pull requests

Pull requests made from branches in the bcgov/gwells repo will kick off a dev pipeline, which runs tests and deploys a preview environment containing your changes.  The pull request page will update when the environment is deployed and mandatory checks (unit tests, etc.) pass or fail.

## Architecture

GWELLS uses PostgreSQL (with PostGIS), Django REST Framework, and Vue.js. We also use both AWS S3 and a self-hosted Minio service for storing documents.

Our production and staging environments run on an OpenShift container platform cluster. OpenShift templates for services are located in the `openshift/` folder, along with more information about dev and staging environments on our cluster.
